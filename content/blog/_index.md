<!-- 
The _index.md file in your content folder is known as a "section bundle".

A section is a collection of content. For example, all the content files in your blog directory form a "blog" section. The _index.md file is used to provide metadata and content that you can access from the list page of that section. The metadata (front matter) can be accessed using `.Params` and the content can be accessed using `.Content`.
