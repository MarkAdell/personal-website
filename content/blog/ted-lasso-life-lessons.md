Following are the life lessons I collected while re-watching *Ted Lasso* Apple TV show.

- Get comfortable being uncomfortable.
- Don't take things personally.
- Be a goldfish.
- Vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness.
- Be accountable for your mistakes.
- Embrace change.
- All people are different people.
- Doing the right thing is never the wrong thing.
- Don't let the wisdom of age be wasted on you.
- Be curious, not judgmental.
- What you think about yourself matters much more about what other people think about you.
- Everyone is fighting a battle you know nothing about.
- Everyone can benefit from therapy.
- Truth will set you free, but first, it will piss you off.
- The fact that we are paid to do our jobs doesn't mean that we don't care about it.
- The best way to deal with people trying to hurt you is to make sure they know that their actions don't affect you.
- There are situations where friends only need your support, not your advice.
- It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.
- A good mentor hopes you will move on, a great mentor knows you will.
- Opening up and expressing your emotions is important when you have conflicts or disagreements with people who matter to you.
- We deserve to be loved, whether we have been hurt or have hurt somebody else.
- You matter, regardless of what you do or don't achieve.
- Forgiving people will set you free from anger and emotional burdens, and will help you find inner peace.
- Don't worry about something that hasn't happened yet.
- Stop letting yesterday get in the way of today.
- Understand that your partner might need occasional alone time, and it doesn't mean they are distancing themselves or losing interest in the relationship.
- Forgive your parents for the mistakes they made while raising you. Like anyone else, they didn't have perfect parents themselves, and they tried their best with the tools they had.
- Not everything has to be perfect; imperfections add beauty and character to our lives.
- Overwhelming your partner with excessive affection and attention, known as love bombing, is not a healthy way to develop a relationship.
- Don't judge people by the actions of their weakest moments, but rather, by the strength they show when they are given a second chance.
- If your partner has passed away, don't be afraid to talk to your children about their deceased parent and pretend that everything is okay. They need you to provide guidance and support them through the grieving process.
