# Personal Website

This is my personal website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator.

I used [Hugo PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) as the base template and made the following modifications:

- Made several updates and additions to the UI/UX to suit my needs.
- Removed several features that were not needed and added new ones.
- Updated/restrcuctured several components of the code to make it more maintainable for me.

Feel free to reuse this code to build your own website, but be aware that it will not include all the features in the original template. Also, please be sure to include the LICENSE file from this repository in your project to comply with licensing terms.
